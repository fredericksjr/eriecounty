# Erie County Utilities

convertNASReports is a tool for converting NYS NAS text files trom text to xlsx files in order to be pulled in to various databases and applications like SQLm, Crystal Reports & Dynamics 365.

These utilities are as is and are copied/used at your own risk.  The author (me) takes no responsiblity for incorrect conversions.  There will be an attempt to keep these up to date.  Use pyinstaller to convert the py source to an executable (pyinstaller --onefile <python_source_file_name>).
